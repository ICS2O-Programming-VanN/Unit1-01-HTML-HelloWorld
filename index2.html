    <h1>Shopify Dev Degree</h1>
    <h2>What is it? Why do I want to take it?</h2>
    <p>In grade 12 I want to apply for the Shopify Dev Degree which is a Computer Science degree with co-op at Shopify (and paid tuition), you can learn more with the link below. I want to take it for various reasons, such as the paid tuition, guaranteed co-op + pay and the great experience that I could use and learn. Obviously this program is very competitive so if I were to get rejected, I won't feel bad and most likely just pursue a regular Computer Science degree. However, to maximize my chances, I would like to learn more about coding and gain as much work experience as possible.</p>
